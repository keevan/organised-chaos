# organised-chaos
Somewhat of a vanity project, the idea being you have code linters and sniffers and beautifiers that apply automatic fixes for everything, but in a chaotic way (not human friendly), but it's consistently done and thus organised. Maybe with such rules applied, within the chaos, there could be... clean code? haha
